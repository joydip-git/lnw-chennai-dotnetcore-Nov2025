New Features of C#
	- Lambda Expression
Reflection

Indexer:
--------------------
a special type of property which is invoked on the current instance
used to assign value to or get value from multiple data members (one at a time)
used with collections of elements, such as an array or generic collection classes
can be used to accept one or more than one argument apart from the actual value to be assigned to or to get from a data member


Generic:
----------------------
any method, class, interface, data member or even delegates can be generic
in case of collections, it helps to avoid boxing and unboxing
it helps in type safety
it provides compile time checking mechanism


ILDASM: Intermediate Language DisAssembler
disassemble the IL code


Automatic Properties:
--------------------------------
you can declare a property inside a class with out explicitly declaring a data member and without having code for set and get accessor
the compiler (Roslyn) will produce IL code with private fields (data members) for those properties and will overwrite the set and get accessor of the properties
