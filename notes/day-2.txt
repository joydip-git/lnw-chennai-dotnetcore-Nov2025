New Features of C#
	- Lambda Expression
Reflection

Indexer:
--------------------
a special type of property which is invoked on the current instance
used to assign value to or get value from multiple data members (one at a time)
used with collections of elements, such as an array or generic collection classes
can be used to accept one or more than one argument apart from the actual value to be assigned to or to get from a data member


Generic:
----------------------
any method, class, interface, data member or even delegates can be generic
in case of collections, it helps to avoid boxing and unboxing
it helps in type safety
it provides compile time checking mechanism


ILDASM: Intermediate Language Disassembler
disassemble the IL code


Automatic Properties:
--------------------------------
you can declare a property inside a class with out explicitly declaring a data member and without having code for set and get accessor
the compiler (Roslyn) will produce IL code with private fields (data members) for those properties and will overwrite the set and get accessor of the properties

Object and Collection initializer:
---------------------------------------
Object can be instantiated using the properties directly using the following syntax:
<class-name> <var-name> = new <Class-name>{prop1=value, prop2=value,...};
Product p = new Product {Id=1, Name="", Price=1000};
or
Product p = new() {Id=1, Name="", Price=1000};

collection instance can be initialized following way (example List<T>)
List<int> list = new List<int>{1,2,3,4,...};
or
List<int> list = [1,2,3,4,...];


Delegate:
------------------------
1. delegate declaration
delegate declaration should be same as that of the method declaration (that you ae trying invoke)

	- return type should be same
	- number, position and data type of arguments should be same

2. delegate instantiation
while instantiating a delegate one should pass the name of the method
	- with the class name if the method is static of that class
	- with the reference variable if the method is non-static

3. delegate invocation
delegate can be invoked with the delegate reference variable (delobj()) or by using the "Invoke" method of the delegate. Pass the arguments to the delegate which are supposed to be passed to the method

the delegate instance can be passed to another method as an argument and called back from that method
